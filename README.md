# Face_Emotion_detection
Detecting the real-time emotion of the person with a camera input is one of the advanced features in the machine learning process. 
The detection of emotion of a person using a camera is useful for various research and analytics purposes. 
The detection of emotion is made by using the machine learning concept. You can use the trained dataset to detect the emotion of the human being. 
For detecting the different emotions, first, you need to train those different emotions, or you can use a dataset already available on the internet.
In this article, we will discuss creating a Python program to detect the real-time emotion of a human being using the camera.
